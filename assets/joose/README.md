Joose is a complete modern object system for JavaScript based on concepts from many programming languages such as Ruby, Smalltalk, Perl and, well, JavaScript. It provides "keywords" or "syntactic sugar" for class declaration, object construction, inheritance and more. These keywords feel like they become a part of the language and you don't have to care about the implementation details of all these concepts.

With Joose, you can concentrate on the logical structure of your code, focusing on "what" rather than "how". A class definition with Joose reads like a list of very concise English sentences.

Joose provides complete introspection for all Joose-using classes. This means you can ask classes about their attributes, parents, children, methods, etc., all using a well-defined API.

Joose is based in large part on the Moose system, which in turn borrows a lot of from Perl 6 object system, as well as drawing on the best ideas from CLOS, Smalltalk, and many other languages.
